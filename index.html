                                John is a busy businessman who needs to send a large number of emails every day to communicate and coordinate with clients and colleagues. However, because he often needs to edit and adjust the format and content of emails, he often spends a lot of time and energy on this, which makes him feel very tired and frustrated.

                                He could focus more on more important tasks and reduce the time and energy costs of writing and sending emails. He was very satisfied and grateful because he could now handle daily work more easily and have more time to focus on his life and family.
